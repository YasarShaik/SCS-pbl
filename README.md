# Smart Helmet for Mining Safety 

This project aims to enhance underground mining safety through a smart helmet that integrates sensors, signal modeling, and embedded communication systems. It monitors:

- Toxic gas concentration  
- Sudden impacts or falls  
- Motion and movement of miners

To ensure real-time safety alerts and reliable data transmission from deep underground to the surface, the project merges two core domains:

- **Signals and Communication Systems (SCS)** – for modeling, analyzing, and simulating the behavior of signals and communication channels using MATLAB
- **Processors and Controllers (P&C)** – for real-world implementation through embedded systems using ARM microcontrollers, sensors, and UART-based data transmission

The overall goal is to simulate the signal behavior under underground conditions and prepare for hardware implementation in the future. This system bridges the gap between communication theory and real-world mining safety technology.

## Embedded System Implementation
This repository focuses on the embedded implementation using the **ARM Cortex-M microcontroller** (e.g., STM32/ATmega). The smart helmet system includes:

### Microcontroller Configuration
- Configured UART for serial communication
- Timers and interrupts for real-time monitoring
- GPIO interfaces for sensors and actuators

### Sensor Integration
- **MQ-135** for toxic gas detection (analog input)
- **Accelerometer (e.g., MPU6050)** for fall detection and motion tracking (I2C/SPI)
- **PIR/Ultrasonic** sensors for movement detection

### Signal Flow
1. Sensors collect physical data (gas, motion, impact)
2. Microcontroller digitizes data using ADC/Digital Input
3. Logic triggers alerts when thresholds are crossed
4. Encoded binary data is transmitted via UART
5. Data is sent to a communication module (e.g., LoRa, Zigbee) for wireless transmission

## Warning & Response System
- Buzzer or LED for local real-time alerts
- Optionally connected display (e.g., OLED/LCD) to show status
- Data sent to a central base station for supervisor monitoring

## Power Supply System
- Designed for portability and underground resilience
- Battery-operated (Li-Ion/3.7V with Boost Converter)
- Voltage regulation using LM7805 or AMS1117
- Capacitor filtering to delete ripples

## Future Add-ons
- Integration  with cloud servers via Wi-Fi/Bluetooth gateways
- GPS tracking for surface positioning
- Energy-efficient sleep modes

## Outcome
This implementation provides the foundation for a reliable, real-time, embedded safety system in mines. Combined with the SCS simulations, it offers a practical solution ready for deployment and scalability.

# MineNet: Bare-Metal Mesh Telemetry for Mining Helmets

## Overview
MineNet is a purpose-built communication and telemetry system for underground mining operations.  
It combines bare-metal embedded programming, mesh networking, and real-time telemetry to enable reliable communication between mining helmets, even in signal-dead underground environments.

## Breakdown of Key Terms

### 1. MineNet
- Why it matters: Indicates the system is designed specifically for mining, not a generic IoT solution.  
- Processor & Comms: Suggests custom hardware + protocol tailored to hostile underground environments.

### 2. Bare-Metal
- Why it matters: No operating system, no pre-built Wi-Fi or BLE stacks.  
- Processor view: Direct register-level coding on the microcontroller (timers, UART, SPI).  
- Signals & Comms view: You build your own protocol → packet framing, timing sync, collision handling.

### 3. Mesh
- Why it matters: Every helmet can act as a relay (helmet → helmet → base).  
- Processor view: Requires memory management for packet forwarding.  
- Signals & Comms view: Stronger fault tolerance; communication persists even if one path fails.

### 4. Telemetry
- Why it matters: Structured continuous data (gas levels, motion, environment).  
- Processor view: Data packed into frames before transmission.  
- Signals & Comms view: Transmission efficiency, low-latency encoding, error detection.

### 5. Mining Helmets
- Why it matters: Integrates into PPE, ensuring practical usage.  
- Processor view: Limited space/power, so firmware must be optimized.  
- Signals & Comms view: Dust, reflections, multipath propagation must be handled in protocol design.


## Processor Perspective
- Direct bare-metal control → efficient and deterministic timing.
- Microcontrollers act as both sensor managers and packet routers.
- Protocol stack designed from scratch → full ownership of MAC & PHY layer behaviors.

## Signals & Communication Perspective
- Custom PHY: timing, modulation, and error coding tuned for underground propagation.  
- Mesh routing: ensures packets can hop between helmets to overcome dead zones.  
- Reliability mechanisms: ACKs, retransmissions, and collision handling improve robustness.  
- Range extension: more helmets = stronger network, even without line-of-sight.


## Summary
MineNet is a bare-metal, mesh-based telemetry system embedded into mining helmets.  
It delivers:
- Robust underground comms (mesh topology bypasses dead zones).  
- Custom lightweight protocol (low power, low overhead).  
- Real-time safety telemetry (gas, motion, environment).  
- Scalability and fault tolerance (more miners = stronger network).  

This approach highlights Processor & Controller (P&C) expertise (register-level protocol design) and Signals & Communication Systems innovation (custom PHY/MAC, mesh routing in harsh conditions).
